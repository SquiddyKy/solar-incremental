# Solar
An early prototype of an incremental game.
Originally created by Ky Letts.

Solar is planned to be a solarpunk-themed incremental/idle game where you grow vegetables, explore a post-apocalyptic wasteland, invent new technologies, and try to re-green your little piece of the planet. While it's still in the very early stages of development, much is planned for this game, and hopefully it will be released bit by bit.
